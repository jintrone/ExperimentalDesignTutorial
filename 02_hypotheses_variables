# Hypotheses

A hypothesis is a tentative explanation or prediction that can be tested. A hypothesis is often structured as an if-then statement, predicting how changes in one variable (independent) will affect another variable (dependent).  Note that a hypothesis is _not_ the same as a theory, although it can be a step to creating one. 

A **theory** is a well-substantiated explanation of an aspect of the natural world that has been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experimentation. Theories are broad and can incorporate multiple hypotheses, providing a comprehensive explanation for a phenomenon based on a vast amount of evidence.

A **hypothesis**, on the other hand, is a specific, testable prediction about the relationship between two variables. It's an educated guess based on existing knowledge that serves as a starting point for investigation. In scientific research, hypotheses play a crucial role by guiding experiments. They are formulated to be either supported or refuted through empirical evidence, leading to a deeper understanding of the natural world.

**Characteristics of a Good Hypothesis:**
   - Clear and concise: A good hypothesis should be straightforward and precise.
   - Testable: It must be possible to support or refute the hypothesis through experimentation.
   - Predictive: A hypothesis should make a clear prediction about the relationship between two variables.
   - Scientific rationale: It should be grounded in existing knowledge or theories.

**Examples**

"Plants will grow better with some kind of light."

- This statement is not a testable hypothesis; it's overly general and does not predict a specific relationship between variables. It fails to specify what "better" growth means or the type of light, making it impossible to design an experiment around it.

"If plants are exposed to ultraviolet light, then their growth rate will decrease, because ultraviolet radiation can damage cellular DNA, inhibiting photosynthesis."

- This hypothesis is clear, testable, and provides a specific prediction with a scientific rationale linking UV exposure to potential DNA damage and its effect on plant growth.

"Eating more fruits and vegetables makes you healthier."

- This hypothesis is too broad and vague. "Healthier" is not specifically defined, nor is there a clear independent or dependent variable. It lacks specificity about the relationship being tested.

"If high school students sleep less than 7 hours on school nights, then their academic performance will decline, as insufficient sleep impairs cognitive function and memory retention."

- It's specific, relates directly to measurable variables (hours of sleep and academic performance), and includes a rationale based on known effects of sleep on cognition.

"Tomato plants will grow better with more water."

- This lacks specificity and doesn't explain the scientific rationale.

"If soil moisture levels increase, then the growth rate of tomato plants will improve, because plants with adequate water have better conditions for photosynthesis and growth."

- What do you think?

**Crafting a Hypothesis - Step by Step Guide:**
   - **Identify the variables:** Choose your independent and dependent variables based on your problem statement.
   - **Make a prediction:** Based on what you know or what existing science suggests, predict how changes in the independent variable will affect the dependent variable.
   - **Provide a rationale:** Briefly explain why you expect this outcome, based on scientific principles or previous research.

#### Example

Taking the example of the following observation "Plants exposed to 12 hours of light per day grow faster than those exposed to 8 hours," let's walk through the process of crafting a good hypothesis.

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Independent variable: Hours of light exposure per day (12 hours vs. 8 hours).
   - Dependent variable: Growth rate of plants.

2. **Make a Prediction:**
   - Based on the observation, predict that increasing light exposure to 12 hours will enhance plant growth compared to 8 hours.

3. **Formulate the Hypothesis:**
   - "If plants are exposed to 12 hours of light per day, then they will grow faster than plants exposed to only 8 hours of light per day, due to increased photosynthesis time."

### Potential Pitfalls:
- **Overgeneralization:** Assuming this applies to all plant types without specifying the plant species could lead to incorrect conclusions.
- **Assuming Causation:** Just because two variables are correlated (light exposure and growth rate) does not necessarily mean one causes the other. Be open to other contributing factors.
- **Lack of Specificity:** Not clearly defining what "grow faster" means could make the hypothesis difficult to test. Be precise about how growth rate is measured.

#### Activity

Use the following observations to craft good hypotheses:

- Observation: "In a school garden, tomato plants watered with diluted seawater appear to be more robust and bear more fruit than those watered with tap water."
- Observation: "Students who study in a quiet room perform better on math tests than those who study in a room with background music."


# Variables

Variables as elements of an experiment that can change or be changed. There are three types of variables:

1. **Independent Variables:**
   - Independent variables as factors that the experimenter changes intentionally to observe their effect on the dependent variable. 

2. **Dependent Variables:**
   - Explain dependent variables as the outcomes or effects measured in the experiment. Highlight how these are expected to change in response to manipulations of the independent variable.

3. **Controlled Variables:**
   - Detail controlled variables as constants throughout the experiment to ensure that any changes in the dependent variable are due to the independent variable alone. It is important to identify and maintain consistency in these variables or else they can become "confounds" which make it hard to correlate changes in your dependent variables with your manipulations of indepedent variables.

### Example

Consider an experiment investigating the effect of different types of music on plant growth.

- **Independent Variable (IV):** The type of music played (classical, rock, silence), which is changed by the researcher to observe its effect.
- **Dependent Variable (DV):** The growth rate of the plants, measured in height increase, which depends on the type of music they're exposed to.
- **Controlled Variables (CVs):** Factors like the amount of water, soil type, light exposure, and room temperature are kept constant to ensure any growth differences are due to the music type alone, not other environmental factors.


## **Operational Definitions:**

An **operational definition** in experimental design specifies how a concept is measured or manipulated within a study, ensuring clarity and enabling replicability. It turns abstract concepts into measurable observations.

** Good operational definition **
- Variable: Study duration for students.
- Definition: "Study duration is defined as the total uninterrupted time, measured in minutes, a student spends on academic activities between 6 PM and 9 PM on school nights."

**Bad operational definition **
- Variable: Plant growth.
- Definition: "Plant growth is observed by how much bigger the plant looks after two weeks."
- This definition lacks specificity in measurement, making it subjective and hard to replicate.

### **Activity:**

For the following scenarios, identify independent, dependent, and controlled variables, and to give operational definitions for each.

- **Experiment Description:** Researchers study the impact of light pollution on nocturnal insect populations in urban versus rural areas. They measure insect activity using light traps over a six-month period.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  - **Independent Variable (IV):** The level of light pollution (urban vs. rural areas).
  - **Dependent Variable (DV):** Nocturnal insect population activity, measured by the number of insects caught in light traps nightly.
  - **Controlled Variables (CVs):** Type of light trap used, time of night when traps are active, duration traps are left out.
  - **Operational Definitions:** 
    - **Light Pollution:** Categorized based on area: 'urban' areas are those with artificial lighting visible after 9 PM; 'rural' areas have no artificial lighting visible after 9 PM.
    - **Nocturnal Insect Activity:** Quantified by counting the number of insects captured in the traps between 9 PM and 5 AM each night.

- **Experiment Description:** A study investigates whether group study or solo study is more effective for learning new vocabulary in a foreign language among high school students, assessed by a test after one week.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  - **Independent Variable (IV):** Study method (group study vs. solo study).
  - **Dependent Variable (DV):** The number of new vocabulary words correctly recalled in a test.
  - **Controlled Variables (CVs):** Number of vocabulary words studied, study duration, time of day when studying occurs, the difficulty level of the vocabulary.
  - **Operational Definitions:**
    - **Study Method:** 'Group study' involves studying with two or more peers; 'solo study' involves studying alone.
    - **Vocabulary Recall:** Measured by a standardized test consisting of 50 new vocabulary words, with recall success quantified by the number of words correctly translated.
</details>

These scenarios are designed to practice identifying different types of variables in experimental setups and formulating operational definitions to ensure clarity and replicability in research.

7. **Discussion and Feedback:**
   - Review student responses, offering feedback on their identification and definitions of variables. Discuss common mistakes or oversights, such as confusing independent and dependent variables or neglecting controlled variables.

This structure aims to comprehensively cover the types of variables in experimental design, aligning with the rubric's requirements and ensuring students grasp the importance of clear definitions and control in scientific research.
